# malware-detection

## Description

This project is a simple malware detection script written in Python. It uses Yara rules to detect malware, and VirusTotal to scan files. It also uses olevba to analyze malicious documents, and extract obfuscated VBA scripts. It also uses pefile to analyze PE files, and extract information about the file. It also uses python-magic to detect the file type.
